## My process

- First I used the html template provided by Frontend Mentor and wrapped texts inside divs, sections, spans, articles, link tags, to name a few.
- Then made a new SCSS file and used it create the CSS file. Using SCSS and SASS just makes life easier.
- After all the coding and styling the final outome is here.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Using SCSS 
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

So what have I learned from this project?

  - Be aware of how the HTML syntax is layed out. It was literally hell for me when I saw the not knowing and random classes. Think about the HTML syntax first and when you think the HTML you are ðŸ’¯ then go for the styling part.
  - To keep your CSS dry and use some plugins (if in VS Code) from the MarketPlace for better visibility of code because it gets very messy when you write 100+ lines of code. 
  - Also when using something like Flex and Grids in a layout the most best thing is to revisit the reference. (when you are relatively new to the world of web development)

### Continued development

What I want to continue on?
  - Well I found out that I'm not very versed in how Flexbox and Grids work so will revisit them again.
  - The Semantic HTML am confused with and will learn it again.
  - Also learning about SASS/SCSS syntax which will make my life easier as how it is now.

### Useful resources

- [freeCodeCamp](https://www.freecodecamp.org/) - Obvious it is here because this site offers such value to students that is free. I bet on them that they will go down in history and the coming genrations of coders, web devs etc. will be known from this.
- [MDN Web Docs](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS) - If you are in this field for quite some time then you propably know about it. Learning Web Development without Mozilla's Web Docs is almost impossible. There are many great and amazing resources but after sometime you will come back to MDN.
